# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was hired to design and create code that would read course data from a file, sort the data by course ID, and print the data. The code needed to utilize a data structure to hold the information and access it quick and efficiently.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The assignments were instrumental in helping understand the concepts involved. By working with each of the data structures, I was able to understand the pros and cons of each and make an informed decision for the code. Given the amount of data one is meant to work with, it is important to pick the right data structure to ensure the code runs efficiently.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I did a lot of research and asked questions. Professor Mike was very helpful throught the project, as was my classmates. The class discussion was critical to my success. I tested/tried many things and looked up the stuff I didn't know.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I have a better understanding of Big O-notation and the worst-case runtimes. It was not something I was concerned about before, but now I understand why it is important. I hope to use this information in future projects to help keep thing running quickly.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I am not great at planning code. I typically just like to go in and move stuff around until things start working, but I know this is not the best way. I can save myself a lot of time and headaches by just diagraming and writing pseudocode first. I will try to hone this skill because it will be very helpful in my progragming career.
